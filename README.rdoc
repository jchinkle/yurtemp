This is a ruby application that takes temperature data posted via a JSON REST API and displays it in a mobile friendly format.

I use this with a TEMPer1 USB Temperature sensor to continually track the temperature in my yurt when I am not at home.

A Raspberry PI utilizes the sensor, and posts to this application, which I host in Heroku.
